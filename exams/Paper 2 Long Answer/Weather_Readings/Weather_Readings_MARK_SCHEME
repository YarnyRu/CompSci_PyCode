// Example 15 mark answer in pseudocode
// meaningful identifiers and appropriate data structures for
// all data required

// Diana's comment - the question clearly stated variables and arrays do NOT need to be declared, 
// so I can only assume this is here 'for completeness' to show how it would be done

DECLARE Days : ARRAY[1:7] OF STRING
DECLARE Readings : ARRAY[1:7, 1:24] OF REAL
DECLARE AverageTemp : ARRAY[1:7] OF REAL
DECLARE WeekLoop : INTEGER
DECLARE DayLoop : INTEGER
DECLARE InTemp : REAL
DECLARE TotalDayTemp : REAL
DECLARE TotalWeekTemp : REAL
DECLARE AverageWeekTemp : REAL

// Initialisation of Days[] array
// Diana's comment - this IS needed for this question, but you could use Mon-Sun or anything similar

Days[1] <- "Sunday"
Days[2] <- "Monday"
Days[3] <- "Tuesday"
Days[4] <- "Wednesday"
Days[5] <- "Thursday"
Days[6] <- "Friday"

// Input temperatures inside nested loop
// Diana's comment - for any 2D array you will need two 'nested' loops to iterate through all the data
