Summertime Coding Challenge #1

Write me a program that asks the user what the temperature is today (imagine that in future this could be linked automatically to a Raspberry Pi with a SenseHat that is monitoring the outdoor temperature)

Depending on the answer, the program should either:
1.	Tell the user that number is not a sensible temperature, and ask them to re-enter a number
2.	Convert the temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit if they say they are American
3.	Depending on the temperature given, suggest appropriate clothing for the day (yes, you can make this funny!)
	Think about how you will ensure that every sensible temperature entered should have one output phrase
4.	Ask the user if they would like to update their temperature/enter another reading.

All your interaction with the user should have nicely written prompts, so that the user knows exactly what to type each time.
Your code should contain comments so that you (and I) can read and understand what you've written in six months' time.

Good luck!
